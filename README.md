# About me
I am a self taught and experienced system administrator. I have been using Linux for 5 years and use Gentoo as my default Linux system. I am familiar with evaluating and solving issues in a computer system that have complex requirements and constraints. I use these skills to maintain a transparent, yet straightforward, computer system for myself.
